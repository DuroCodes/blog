# Why Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a framework used for building fast static websites. I chose this over [Next](https://nextjs.org/) for my blog because of it's usage with static sites.

The performance with Astro is generally better than the performance with Next. I was also motivated by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP3QVrveSvI) by **Theo Browne**.

# How I Started

I started this project by looking at the `Astro CLI`, and I chose the 'Blog' template to start building the website with.

I was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_JE76PKBWE) by **devaslife** on YouTube to start building a blog.
